As college students, walking alone at night can feel scary yet for many of us it is inevitable. In those moments, we often wish we had someone on the phone with us, walking us home. That experience inspired us to build Stride, an app that helps people feel safer and less alone when they’re out by themselves.

Stride lets users start a realistic fake phone call with a character of their choice such as Mom, Dad, or a Friend. Once the call begins, the app displays a phone-like UI and plays an AI-generated one sided conversation, complete with natural pauses so the user can respond. The goal is to make it look and feel like you’re genuinely on a call while walking.

We used Gemini to generate dynamic conversation scripts based on the chosen character. We then passed those lines to ElevenLabs, converting them into lifelike audio. On the frontend, we designed a clean, believable call interface and connected everything to the backend so the audio plays in sequence with pauses.
